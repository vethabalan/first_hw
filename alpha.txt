Step1: Input string from the user and store in a variable named as str.
Step2: I take a variable "count=0" to count the frequency of each character and "n".
Step3: To go through every element i take outer for "i=0" and inner for loop "j=i+1" "(i=0;i<n;i++)" "(j=i+1;j<n;j++)".
Step4: Inside the for loop an if condition is applied to check the string until space(a[i]!=" ").
Step5: Inside the if condition check if a[i]==a[j],if it is true then count gets increment(count++).
Step6: After every time each character gets counted it prints the count of the element(printf("%s=%d",str,count)).
Step7: After printing the frequency of the element the count value assign to 0.
